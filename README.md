# Optimization model of EHDO

This repository contains the **calculation code** of the webtool **EHDO**.
EHDO can be accessed here: https://ehdo.eonerc.rwth-aachen.de

EHDO (Energy hub design optimization) is a user-friendly, free webtool for planning complex multi-energy systems. It is used in academic teaching in **Energy Engineering** at **RWTH Aachen University**. 

## Files

This repository contains 5 files:

- ```optim_model.py```: 
     > The EHDO optimization model with all constraints, variables and objective functions.
- ```load_params.py```:
